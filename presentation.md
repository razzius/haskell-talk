...

Haskell is a programming language. Here is hello world.

```haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello World"
```

Let's compile and run it.

---

```sh
ghc hello.hs
./hello
Hello World
```

Haskell is compiled. GHC is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

---

Fortunately, ghc comes with an interactive shell, ghci.

Let's experiment with it.

Haskell has many characteristics that make it unique.

 - lazy
 - pure
 - functional
